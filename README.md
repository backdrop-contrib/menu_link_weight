# Menu Link Weight

If you have ever been annoyed by adding a menu item on a node form and then
you had to go to admin/structure/menu/manage/main-menu to reorder the (sub-)items
then Menu Link Weight is for you.

This module replaces the standard numeric weight widget for menu links in the node form
with a tabledrag widget that lists all children for the selected parent.
Just drag and drop the order you need.
